📊 HR Employee Data Analysis & Visualization using Python
🧠 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing HR employee data to help organizations make data-driven decisions. The dataset (sourced from Kaggle) contains key employee information such as age, gender, department, salary, hiring details, marital status, and employment status.
Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the data was cleaned, processed, converted into a structured Excel file, and visualized to derive meaningful insights that support HR reporting and workforce planning.
